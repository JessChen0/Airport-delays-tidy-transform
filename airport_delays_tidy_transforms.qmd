## Approach

\(1\) Create .csv file (try MySQL database)

\(2\) Upload into R and use tidyr and dplyr to tidy and transform

\(3\) Compare arrival delays, be sure to include the following requirements from assignment:

-   Compared percentage (not just counts) of either delays or arrival rates for two airlines overall. \[Either with a chart, or a table; both would be exemplary\].  Include text summarizes findings from this comparison. (+10)

-   Compared percentage (not just counts) of either delays or arrival rates for two airlines across five cities. \[Either with a chart, or a table; both would be exemplary\].  Include text summarizes findings from this comparison. (+10)

-   Describe discrepancy between comparing two airlines’ flight performances city-by-city and overall. (+5)

-   Explain discrepancy between comparing two airlines’ flight performances city-by-city and overall.(+5)
